A multi-stage build in a Dockerfile is a feature that allows you to create multiple stages in a single Dockerfile, each with its own set of instructions. This allows you to separate the build process into different stages, such as building, testing, and deploying, and to use different base images for each stage.
In a traditional build, all build instructions are executed in sequence, and in a single build container: downloading dependencies, compiling code, and packaging the application. All those layers end up in your final image. This approach works, but it leads to bulky images carrying unnecessary weight and increasing your security risks. This is where multi-stage builds come in.
Multi-stage builds introduce multiple stages in your Dockerfile, each with a specific purpose. Think of it like the ability to run different parts of a build in multiple different environments, concurrently. By separating the build environment from the final runtime environment, you can significantly reduce the image size and attack surface. This is especially beneficial for applications with large build dependencies.
